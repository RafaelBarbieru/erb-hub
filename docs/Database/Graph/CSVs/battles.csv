"Ragnar Lodbrok vs Richard The Lionheart",176,"2020-12-05","I am Richard the first, from the third crusade
That only leaves room for you in second place
The chivalrous swinger of the sword and mace
And I'll kill you when I spit like a pit full of snakes
I'm the number one dick rising up to make you feel small
My battering ram slams through your shield wall
I'll announce at the next of your things
That I'm chomping through your family like boneless wings
Of course you got avenged by a kid with no bones
Your own story ended worse than Game of Thrones
Your son killed your ex, your ex killed your wife
I'm the Lion King, man, but that's a messed up circle of life
Half-assed head tats can't be condoned
It's like you raided the face of Post Malone
I'm scared of no foe, I'm backed by the Trinity
I'll conquer you on my day off like you were Sicily
Threatening to conquer Ragnar is bold
For a king who got whacked by a ten year old
I'll sacrifice you to Odin while drinking horns of mead
Good thing you hold a red cross 'cause that's who you're going to need
You built your army by raising English taxes
I raise my army taxing English asses with my axes
And who are you to talk about the circle of life?
Your old lady can't feel the love on any night
Your only son was illegitimate, you heired on the side
I'll twist your spine like the end of the Plantagenet line
I'm just a warrior, I'm not a linguist
But I think the king of England should probably speak english
You took Acre and Jaffa like a piece of cake
But never attacked Jerusalem, for Christ's sake
You saw the holy land but couldn't go all the way
We should call it the crusade of Richard the First base
Sail back north with your barbarian goons
Because I'm tearing down your legacy, leaving it in runes
Your real self next to your legend disappoints
I see you shaking in your shaggy little pants like Zoinks
Who invented the royal me? We
Who's the predominantly fictional MC? Thee
You're a wannabe, mon ami, kneel down and honor me
Richard coming through in the end like Sean Connery
The double-coronated blood and gore gourmet
You might have the axe, but I make a body spray
Lionheart's the sobriquet but I strike like a cobra
If I wanted to fight loser Vikings, I'd go to Minnesota
You want to fight me? Take off the tin shirt
I'll be waiting in my birthday suit, going berserk
Ding dang dong, morning bells warn about me at the break of dawn
And I'm putting you to sleep like your brother John
Leaving monks in chunks on Northumbrian lawns
'Cause I'm the Allfather's spawn
You couldn't even beat a salad in a fight
You're as soft as Monty Python knights
You went from chainmail to chained up in jail
Til Mommy drained England to pay for your bail
But no king's ransom will save you from these bars, son
I'm eating you alive like the gangrene you died from","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgJMaP4msTs&ab_channel=ERB","https://open.spotify.com/track/5SLgay95kz6KUq8lwn4RGJ?si=3c0492fa5d234bed","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kgJMaP4msTs/maxresdefault.jpg"
"Harry Potter vs Luke Skywalker",274,"2021-06-14","Accio mic! Let me fire up the wand
Like Hermione and Ron, I'm about to get it on
'Cause my mouth spits hot like incendio flames
You're Lukewarm, like some Tauntaun remains
Even the mad eye of my man Alastor Moody could see
Your franchise only has two decent movies
Search your feelings, do sense déjà vu?
You're getting smoked like your Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru
Your acting is flat and your raps are 2D too
Bugger off to the afterlife where you're fat and see-through
You're the biggest letdown in your series since Snoke
It makes sense your father's Vader, all you do is choke
You country bumpkin, you must be dumb
Who farms moisture on a desert planet with two suns?
Let me stick my plans in your Dusty Bin droid
I'll leave you like a Horcrux split up and destroyed
I don't know who made you shoot first, but that missed
If I was you I'd have a bad feeling 'bout this
I'm a rhyming Jedi like my father before me
You're talking hat shoulda put you in Gryffindorky
Your origin story is mostly stolen from me
You might be Potter, but Harry, I planted your seed
Let's see little orphan raised by relatives in solitude
Suddenly gets taken under wing of funky wizard dude
Learns that he's been destined to have powerful gifts
But between the two of us I think I got the cooler stick (Swing it)
My mic saber cuts through you so slicey
Leave you on the floor like an arm at Mos Eisley
Hit you with the Wampa raps, I get icy
Land'em in your face like (That'll do nicely)
I fly the X-Wing to save a planet from massacre
You fly a broom like some kind of magical janitor
Your Dumble-dweeb army likes to think that you're the best
All you did was use your mom like a bulletproof vest
The death of my mother saved the wizarding race
Your mum died of heartache when she saw your face
You swamp school dropout! You're too whiney to rhyme
At least when I Slytherin a sister, she isn't mine
I'm the boy who lived, a bestseller without equal
I'll split you like your fan base's feelings 'bout the prequels
The sequels brought you back to meet your demise
I'd say you were brilliant, but I must not tell lies
I left J.K. straight Rowling in cash
You let J.J. compact your character to trash
So go on, try and force more of your disses
You're like a Stormtrooper, 'cause all your shit misses
That's right R2, It does sound like he left all his fire in the goblet
(Boop beep beep)
Haha! Maybe he will get rescued by an anorexic hobbit
I think it's pretty clear that you and I are pretty different
My drive's hyper, your drive's Privet
I've got more rhymes than sand grains on Tatooine
You couldn't pull in the win with a tractor beam
I crushed an empire a galaxy large
I blew up the Death Star you blew up Aunt Marge
I'll pop you where Poppy Pomfrey can't be healing you
Unlike a great disturbance in the Force, I'm not feeling you
Death would eat you up without Hermione and luck
Because your own skills Wingardium Levio-suck
You're a dud like Dursley, but worse
And I'd rather herd nerfs than have to endure your third verse
Have you heard rap before? That was not dope at all
Maybe have Goldieballs show you the protocol
But I bet you're just distracted, you got a lot on your plate
On one hand the rebellion, on the other hand- oh wait...
I roll deep and the Weasley's got my back
This muggle sucks more hole than the bloody Sarlacc
We'll rough you up good if you try to step to Harry, mate
You're the least intimidating twin since Mary-Kate
I flow like butterbeer on Diagon streets
You can find me getting fantastic on these beats
It's over Luke, I got the high ground advantage
I'll close it like a map, Mischief Managed
You should have Hagrid fly you home on his moped
If I wanted teenage wizardry I'd call Selena Gomez
My attack tactics are galactically hardcore
Far more than your goofy little Scar Wars
I learned flow from the best in the biz
(Get funky)
So of you, the end this is
(Maclunkey)
My Jedi mind tricks put the nix on your Imperius
Trip you up like deathsticks, I'm Bellatrix dead Sirius
No need to Expelliarmus, you're harmless in a duel
Call me the Hogwarts Express, I just took you to school.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ver1OZdK2bA&ab_channel=ERB","https://open.spotify.com/track/21nG2V2EwU6a2JaejWq5UA?si=803c77cd2f5d4d31","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ver1OZdK2bA/maxresdefault.jpg"
"Donald Trump vs Joe Biden",228,"2020-10-24","It's the DJT gettin' it on
The Teflon Don on the White House lawn
Against wimps like you, I'll win a third term
Your campaign's like your family, crash and burn
Think looting and violence will keep the MAGA movement quiet?
Resist me? That's a riot
Why don't you step behind the gym, I'll be standing by
We'll see how tough you are against the 45
I shoot a hole through your whole party
Bigger than the one I blew through Qasem Soleimani
Then I go, and I bone on Melania
I'm gonna smash you, Joe, like China
I've got all the best cognition
With all the top grammar
I'm not a little girl's shoulders
So you can't touch this, MC Stammer
You're a disaster inciting hysteria
You say I'm selling hate in America
You're selling hatin' America
Like with Hillary, the people aren't swayed
You're just Barack's shadow
And I don't really like the shade
The pain of losing loved ones is something I have seen
So I know how you must have felt
When they killed Jeffrey Epstein
Rap lyrics just ain't for you
You should stick to love letters for Kim Jong-Un
You're a wrestling heel
Nothing 'bout you is real
Bitch, you didn't even really write The Art of the Deal
But you tapped into the rage of red mad hatters
Well, let me tell you, Trump, all lies matter
I don't want to defund no police
I picked a DA for my VP
I'm not a communist, I'm not a socialist
I'm just an old-ass man with some decency (wrong)
No matter what you try to say
Global warming ain't cancelled
You pulled out of Paris
Should have pulled out of Stormy Daniels
I ain't sleepy, I'm tired
Of you, Donald Trump, you're fired
The only thing getting fired on my watch
Is tear gas from law enforcement
I'll keep America great, you'll unleash Antifa
And keep America like Portland (sad)
Ain't nothin' gonna beat me
No person, woman, man, camera, TV
Eh, they impeached me
I still walked out of DC looking peachy
You got the sloppy, Joe, but no beef
The only white privilege I see are those teeth
Maybe teach your son a thing or two about life
Like there's no hunting season for your dead brother's wife
You and your masks and your knight rider shades
Are getting revoked like you're Roe versus Wade
There's no blue wave, forget it, not coming
It's like I tell, criminals, Joe, stop running
Was Breonna Taylor running, hmm?
You dog whistling fool
I think your Daddy would finally be proud of you
He was a racist asshole, too
Что ты сделал
What's this malarkey?
Ох ебать
Keep at it, and you'll end up in jail, Hoss
I'll take you down like I'm you, and you're a mailbox
From all your wives to the SATs
Everything you ever did, you just had to cheat
'Cause you're too insecure to even look like a loser
You're the worst damn Republican since Herbert Hoover
But you scooped a sycophantic, homophobe Hoosier
Then became the constitution's domestic abuser
200, 000 deaths lying at your door
And you think they're suckers like McCain and the Marine Corps
Sometimes I can't tell for which side you're rootin'
When we go high, you go down on Putin
Truth is, you're scared to lose
You got nothing in the banks 'cept IOUs
Y-Y-You whine about ballots like a bitch
But the only thing that's rigged is taxes for the rich
Look, you're a freeloader, change your name to Tramp
My campaign's ramping up, you can't get down a ramp
I'm pulling away faster than your wife's hand
For the love of democracy, will you shut up, man","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkGK7bitav0&ab_channel=ERB","https://open.spotify.com/track/2kgZ69RmZcaKeyC2O5nrYb?si=d6564b42205b45c4","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkGK7bitav0/maxresdefault.jpg"
"Thanos vs J Robert Oppenheimer",203,"2019-12-19","I am inevitable, immeasurable, inexorable, monstrous
With bars weighing on you harder than your haunting guilty conscience
I am Thanos and I crush tracks like Tesseracts in my palm
You're a pencil-pushing Terran who never learned to love his bomb
Seems you started off a chemist and on your world you were a prodigy
Well, that makes sense, because your rhymes are only hot periodically
Man, I burned the Avengers down to Embers
Sent half your planet to be slaughtered
And now I'm offing Oppenheimer like I did to my daughter
Got a fist of gold when I'm rapping
Six Infinity Gems what I'm packing
Stick your tiny nuclear dick back
Into your pants, Dr. Manhattan
Hadron smashing all your atoms
Best not collide with me when I'm rhyming
'Cause you break and bleed so easy
I think I'll call you Oppen-hymen
It's impossible to top me, Oppie
You just don't have the stones
Apparently the only thing
You're good at wrecking is a home
'Cause you slept with your friend's wife
Right there in your friend's bed
Then got another married girl pregnant
You should've gone for the head
Listening to you took everything I have left
After your raps, I am become deaf
You need an Iron-Man, for that wrinkly-ass skin
And that butt-butt-butt-butt-butt-buttchin
Here we go now
Where's your rhythm? I thought you had the Time Stone
Your punchlines sound like they came from RhymeZone
You might be something in the MCU
But between us, who's the worst MC? You!
Your dialogue's got too many breaks in the syllables
You talk so slow, Drax thinks you're invisible
I cause chain reactions when I'm lyrical
'Cause I got that fissile material
You were born to Eternals, but came out looking so scary
That your own mother tried to make you a temporary
Meanwhile, I've mastered the atom, more than any man alive
Now I'm here to split U like two and three from five
I'm a peaceful man, but I do what I must
You had an evil plan, Thanos, and it left you in the dust
It must leave you enraged when you compare our talents
Because in this battle, there is no balance
For a communist pariah, you come off as awfully cocky
But I'll make you bend the knee in round two like Nagasaki
I'm the box office topper, the Marvel showstopper
Got my name on this win like it's the Thanoscopter
You just got no answer for Fortnite's dopest dancer
I will Loki choke you out like my name was Throat Cancer
You wanna talk about Death?
How about the one that looked at you and swiped left?
I'm the destroyer of worlds
You got your nuts handed to you by a Squirrel Girl
We're in the endgame now, Tinky Winky
I'll finish this like Ant-Man, all up in your stinky
Anyone who believes that ""Thanos did nothing wrong"" crap
Has obviously never heard you rap, oh snap","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1vXC-vKgKg&ab_channel=ERB","https://open.spotify.com/track/6qGs58WcucFNfAsXpBrGJ4?si=4d7e657152544c21","https://images.genius.com/1f54f9dd5ebfa330008b4a9e497786fc.1000x563x1.jpg"
"The Joker vs Pennywise",243,"2019-11-24","In my first appearance
The bat was supposed to slay me
But I can't be killed
That's why they cast the Phoenix to play me
I'm the Harlequin of hate
The clown prince of crime
You're a sewer troll that Steven King wrote between his lines
It's like cocaine
You know what I said
I don't know how any kind of joke could ever go over that head
 ""They all float"" says the quote
But your films, they all sink
Oh and as far as Mr. King goes
I'm a shining man, wink!
I made the Justice League look like just a bunch of super schlubs
You lost to a herd of nerds who call themselves the Losers Club
You'd be gobbled up in Gotham
So stick to your small town
Where you're renowned as ""if it's brown, flush it down"" clown
Hiya, Jokey!
You wanna rap?
Rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap
Oh, why so serious?
You're supposed to be the man who laughs
But those jokes were like your new movie (aha)
Mostly really sad (beep beep)
You're John Doe with my dead lights
You're about to fall from a new height
'Cause you're weak and you've lost every fight
To a knight who wears underwear over his tights (ahahaha)
I haunt nightmares and I'm ruthless
This battle's like poker
The Joker is useless
When he's not in your cards
Call me Arkham Asylum
I'm crazy with bars
Jack Nicholson played you just fine
But lately the class has declined
Jared Leto came out trying to look like he was Tekashi Sixnine
So unless you've got a yummy younger brother
I think you'd better run
'Cause I've got ninety nine red ballons, bitch
And I dare you to take one
Go back in your well
You giggling sewer ginger
You lost to a turtle that wasn't even a ninja
When I flow, I go Mark Ham with ill zingers
I steal the show like Bob Kane stole from Bill Finger (hahaha)
I spit acid, be wowed
Every joke of mine stings
You're ""three night lights and a clown""
Beat by the kid from Stranger Things
When I compare your antics to the fiendish schemes I revel in
They pale like the moonlight you can dance with the devil in
Pennywise likes the devil
We have so much fun together
But no one's dying to play with Joker
Except for maybe Heath Ledger
Puddin, you're an embarassment
I'll beat you like you beat Harley Quinn
That purple suit is something you should only see Steve Harvey in
Hahaha! I feast on your fears
I'm the Derry Maine attraction every twenty seven years
But you know what?
I have a secret (shh)
It's like a very special toy
If you wanna kill a Batman eat him when he's a boy
Don't you lay a finger on my Bat, you little freak
Or I will spend a whole week
Knocking out those prickled teeth (hehehe)
Tell your author for his next gangbang scene
How about a little more PG and a lot less thirteen?
Even I wouldn't stoop to that kind of impropriety
This is earth, you space demon
We live in a society (hahaha)
I've seen your movies so I know you don't hurry
But I'll schoo you down the drain so fast they'll call you Tim Scurry
Ask Robin if I drop bars
I take smiles and I leave scars
Guards in Arkham will admit that the Joker just killed IT (hahaha)
Arkham? Ha! You stole that from HP Lovecraft
Who needs guards when you couldn't even escape
Cesar Romero's mustache
You jester, I'm Montresor
'Bout to make you my Fortunato
And seal this battle up like it was the Cask of Amontillado (woo)
I spit January ember flames (woo)
You got beat by the Scooby Gang (woo)
I'm the John Wayne of John Wayne Gacys
The underground clown posse
My flow's insane
Poster boy for missing persons posters
Joker's gonna float with me
'Cause he just messed with best wall-eyed rapper
Since the Notorious B.I.G. (Wahaha)","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2WxaeIJcqY&ab_channel=ERB","https://open.spotify.com/track/1y6U28IyN1OTKz4JJYOtiH?si=6f9bc33756cc4613","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R2WxaeIJcqY/maxresdefault.jpg"
