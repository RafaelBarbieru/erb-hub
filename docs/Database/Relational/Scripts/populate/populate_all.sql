We\nWho's the predominantly fictional MC? Thee\nYou're a wannabe, mon ami, kneel down and honor me\nRichard coming through in the end like Sean Connery\nThe double-coronated blood and gore gourmet\nYou might have the axe, but I make a body spray\nLionheart's the sobriquet but I strike like a cobra\nIf I wanted to fight loser Vikings, I'd go to Minnesota\nYou want to fight me? Take off the tin shirt\nI'll be waiting in my birthday suit, going berserk\nDing dang dong, morning bells warn about me at the break of dawn\nAnd I'm putting you to sleep like your brother John\nLeaving monks in chunks on Northumbrian lawns\n'Cause I'm the Allfather's spawn\nYou couldn't even beat a salad in a fight\nYou're as soft as Monty Python knights\nYou went from chainmail to chained up in jail\nTil Mommy drained England to pay for your bail\nBut no king's ransom will save you from these bars, son\nI'm eating you alive like the gangrene you died from",
